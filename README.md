# Matcher

Matcher is a dropping tile mini-game made for use in a larger game world as a small puzzle for the player to complete.
It was built using Unity and C# in with a simple interface to show-case the logic behind grid based algorithms and using different easily changed variables to edit the difficulty and length

## Installation

Download the build and run the .exe file (Code is openable through Unity or your favourite Text editor)


## Usage

Follow the on-screen controls to start the game, then using the mouse to select/deselect the pieces you can swap adjacent tiles in order to try to make matches of 3 4 or 5 (the minimum is changed by the difficulty) try to make the amount of matches required by each difficulty to pass
